# CompSciS24-Hangman
Intro to Computer Science Spring 2024 Final Project/Presentation

Welcome to Hangman!
To play this game is simple:
When you run the code, a module library "random" will select from a pool of words for you to guess. In the console, you will be presented with underscores for each letter in the word and a request for input. Enter only ONE letter, as more than one will be an incorrect guess whether or not they're in the word, and press enter. You have 6 incorrect attempts to guess the word and save the hanging man. For every incorrect guess, it displays remaining attempts, a picture of a hangman and an added limb until it is complete, in which case you lose. 
When you win, it will display "“Good Job! You saved his life. The word was (chosen_word).”
If you lose, it will display "Oops! You hung him out to die. The word was:&quot;, chosen_word).”

The code was immported from where we were working in replit.com

Good luck players!
